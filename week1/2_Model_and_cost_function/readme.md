# Linear Function
* Linear functions are those whose graph is a straight line. 
* A linear function has the following form. y = f(x) = a + bx. 
* A linear function has one independent variable and one dependent variable. The independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y.

### Recognizing Linear function
A function is said to be linear if,

      [Changes in y / Changes in x] (Always Constant)

If its not constant,
its a non-linear function.

# Regression
* Regression(or regression analysis) is a statistical process for estimating the relationship among the variables.
 Typically,

_output (or) dependent variable(price of house)  ===> With 1 or more predictors(or)features (area of house (or) no of bedrooms)_

* Regression model estimates when 1 of the features is change 1 while other remains constant.

Example: Linear regression where dependent variable, modeled as linear function of features. 

***
# Linear Regression:
* A model for modelling relationship between numerical variable(y) and 1 or more explanatory variable(features) as linear function.
* It consists of independent variable  in x axis
* It consists of dependent variable in y axis
#### Conditions:
If independent variable increases and dependent variable increases => +ve relationship
If independent variable increases and dependent variable decreases => -ve relationship

#### Regression Line:[solved by least squared method]
* A straight line that fits through all the different data points.
* In the end we want to minimize the difference between the estimated value and the actual value.

'h' maps from x's to y's
